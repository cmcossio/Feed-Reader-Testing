# Project Overview

In this project I have implemented a number of testing suites to check functionality of an RSS Feed application. This required me to consider synchronous and asynchonrous solutions. 


## Running the Program
<ol>
    <li>Download or clone the file repository from github <a href="">here</a></li>
    <li>Choose a location on your device to unzip all files</li>
    <li>Open a new tab or window on your favorite browser</li>
    <li>Ctrl-o to find and open the index.html. Once you open this file, the RSS feed application will populate</li>
    <li>Jasmine tests are viewable at bottom of the page.</li>
    <li>Utilize the feedreader js file to view/edit test details @ jasmine/spec/feedreader/js</li>
